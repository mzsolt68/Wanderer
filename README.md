Wanderer - The RPG game
The goal is to build a hero based walking on tiles and killing monsters type of game. The hero is controlled in a maze using the keyboard. Heroes and monsters have levels and stats depending on their levels. The goal is reach the highest level by killing the monsters holding the keys to the next level. This was a full week project in my coding bootcamp. I want to continue this project and finish it.
